# House-Price-Analysis-Excel
This project analyzes house prices using data manipulation and statistical techniques in Excel. I performed data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis to uncover trends in real estate pricing.

Key Analysis Steps:
- Subsetted and processed raw data for meaningful insights.
- Identified skewed distributions and applied logarithmic transformations.
- Explored correlations between house prices and key factors (beds, baths, square footage, age).
- Handled missing values using median imputation.
- Categorized numerical values into meaningful bins for deeper analysis.

Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel (Data Analysis, PivotTables, Descriptive Statistics)
Conditional Formatting for missing data
Scatter Plots & Histograms for visualization
